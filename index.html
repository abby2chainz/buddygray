            Buddy Gray was a passionate advocate for the homeless and a transformative community leader in Cincinnatiâ€™s Over-the-Rhine neighborhood. 
            As a driving force behind organizations like the Drop Inn Center, Over-the-Rhine Community Housing (OTRCH), and the Greater Cincinnati Coalition for the Homeless, Buddy dedicated his life to fighting for affordable housing and social justice. 
            He believed deeply in collective action, mentorship, and the power of grassroots organizing. 
            Known for his tireless spirit, compassion, and unwavering commitment, Buddy inspired countless others to carry on the struggle for dignity and equity. 
            Though his life was tragically cut short, his legacy lives on in the people, places, and purpose he helped shape.
